Today we will be exploring the principles and practicalities of [sharing research data](https://osf.io/wp4zu/). 

> ## Share data for the benefit of:
> * The research community
> * The research funders
> * The public
> * The researcher (you!)
{: .checklist}


> ## What could the data be used for?
> * **Reproducibility**: ensuring your data are consistent with the reported results.
> * **Reanalysis/Meta-analysis**: answering different questions to the ones already asked; answering the same question analysed in a different way; contributing to a wider understanding through integration with other similar data.
> * **Common example**: acting as a reference point to facilitate discussion and shared understandings; contributing to a body of observed facts that theories must account for; expand methodology assessment, recommendations and improvement
> * **Teaching**: allowing learners to perform analysis on real data.
> * **Personal backup**: preserving access across computers and institutions.

## What data should be shared

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has a wealth of expert guidance on data sharing and curation. 

In this lesson, we will discuss a condensed form of the [DCC guide on deciding what data to keep](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/five-steps-decide-what-data-keep). 

> ## What data should be shared?
> * **Relevance**: are the data relevant to reported results?
> * **Quality**: is the data sufficiently complete, coherent, valid, etc. to be useful?
> * **Metadata**: can we provide enough information about what the data are, how they were collected, etc?
> * **Demand/appeal**: will the data be of use to specific people? Will the data contribute to existing resources that are of use? Do the data support published research?
> * **Uniqueness**: can the data be easily reproduced (e.g. random numbers from a seeded generator)
{: .checklist}

> ## What policies apply?
> * **Journal policies**
> * **Institutional policies**
> * **Funder policies**
> * **Government policies**, which may include security classification and freedom of information policies.
> * **Contract/patent rules**
> * **Use for legal/public/police enquiries**
> * **Personal data rules (GDPR)**
> * **Ethics and consent**

## Attaining consent to share

Inform participants about what data will be stored, how it will be preserved, how it is likely to be used in the long-term, and how confidential it will be protected. The UK Data Service has a bank of example sharing-friendly forms for different types of data. 

Ensure consent forms do not promise to destroy the data or promise that the data will only be seen or accessed by the research team

[UK Data Service guidance on seeking participant consent to share data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/consent-data-sharing.aspx)

[Example wordings](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/consent-data-sharing/consent-forms.aspx)

> ## Costs of sharing
> * **Curation**: getting the data in an open format; adding metadata and creating a data dictionary.
> * **Storage**: housing in a repository and keeping available.

## Data management plan

The DCC are responsible for the widely-used [DMPonline data management plan form](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/).



## Negotiating Ethics for Data Sharing

In this section, we're going to have a discussion as to how we can prepare ethics submissions ready for institutional approval (IRBs). Data sharing norms are changing, but ethics systems and indeed gatekeepers are sometimes not always fully prepared for supporting data sharing. 


## Activity 
Review your local ethical approval processes and identify where you can make comments about data sharing. Design some boilerplate statements which can be input into these sections to reassure reviewers and institutions that data sharing can be ethical and advantageous. Some examples are below:

- When will the data be deleted? Participants explicitly consent to having their data shared publicly following project completion. A copy of the final dataset (de-identified by removing demographic details) will be made publicly accessible on the project's OSF page. Any raw data files will be permanently deleted from XX/XX/XXXX.
- Where will data be stored? De-identified data from this project will be publicly accessible from the project OSF page (osf.io/XXXX). Upon completion of data collection, the data will be saved upon my university Microsoft OneDrive and then deleted from Qualtrics. Any raw data will only be shared amongst the research team through Microsoft OneDrive where it will be password protected.
